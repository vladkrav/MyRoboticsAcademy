# Final Master's Thesis - University of Alcalá 

# Design and Implementation of the AmigoBot robot in the MatLab-ROS and Robotics-Academy programming environments

In this Final Master’s Thesis (TFM) is carried out the implementation of a series of algorithms for robotic applications (such as SLAM, VFH, AMCL, PRM), in the first instance. This implementation is carried out in the environment of MatLab and ROS.
Next, a new environment for robotic learning called Robotics-Academy is presented. In this platform, the implementation of some robotic applications that have been mentioned above will be carried out, leaving these applications at the disposal of the Open Source community with a GPL license. Finally, a comparison between both platforms is addressed.
